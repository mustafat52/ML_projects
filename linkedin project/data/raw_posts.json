    "text": "An IIT Mumbai graduate. A PhD holder. A scientist. Now driving a cab in San Jose, trying to make ends meet after being laid off a year ago.\n\nThe world sees the 'American Dream' as this shiny, idealistic vision. But for many immigrants, itâ€™s a battle â€“ a constant tug of war between dreams and reality.\n\nThe driver in this story explains how he canâ€™t go back to India, despite wanting to, because his life is now rooted here â€“ kids in school, mortgage payments, insurance.\n\nThe phrase 'Tasalli Nahin Hai' (thereâ€™s no peace) captures it perfectly. Even with all the effort and resilience, thereâ€™s a void that hard work alone canâ€™t fill.\n\nItâ€™s heartbreaking to think about brilliant minds being in positions that don't reflect their capabilities. The driver says he thinks of going back home 'every day,' but the sacrifices make it impossible. This story isnâ€™t just his â€“ itâ€™s the reality of countless others navigating life between what they are and what theyâ€™re forced to be.\n\nThis is a reminder: success isnâ€™t always about the title you hold or the work you do. Itâ€™s about the value you bring to the world, even if itâ€™s unnoticed by most.\n\nTo all the brilliant, hardworking people out there feeling stuck or undervalued: You are more than your current situation. I hope you find peace and the opportunity to shine again. You deserve it.\n\nIf youâ€™ve faced challenges like this or know someone who has, letâ€™s share stories and support each other. Because sometimes, a little recognition and empathy can go a long way.",

(I am a Punjabi :p)\n\nI reached early and saved myself a spot and this was my first time, I was standing in the front area just behind the fence.\n\nA family came with 7 kids, forcing everyone to help their kids come forward so that they can see.\n\nI gave a spot to one of them, then slowly the sisters started b*tching about everyone in the front row - 'Yeh aunty aisi hai, waisi hai'\n\nHer mother asked me to let her come forward and I should step back because 'bache hai yeh log' (they're kids)\n\nI politely declined.\n\nI wasn't born in a privileged family. For this family, the father paid for 9 people (as he said)\n\nI am attending a concert for the first time with my hard-earned money.\n\nThis is my first time experience as well.\n\nI would've thought about helping the family if the kids were kind but unfortunately they were very rude. They called a lot of people 'b*tch', 'stupid' etc in front of me (including me)\n\nAs the concert progressed, everyone started dancing, the family had problems with that as well.\n\n'Haath aa rahe hai inke photo mein' (Their hand is coming in between)\n'Seedhe kyu nahi khade rehte, video kharab kar di' (Why can't they stand straight, they're ruining my video)\n\nA humble request to everyone out here -\n\nKids are beautiful. I don't hate children but don't expect others to be kind with them all the time just because they're 'children' - respect isn't dependent on age.\n\nTo all the parents who have the money to give their children the best out here - I am happy for you but you need to understand that some of us come from the middle class and we're paying for these things from our hard-earned money.\n\nSometimes the children forget basic 'sanskaar' because they're used to getting everything they want without realising it's worth.\n\n'Jaha humaare sapne pure hote hai, waha innke struggle shuru hote hai'\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "Trigger warning - Mention of suicide and self-harm.\n\nI talk a lot about mental health in my posts but I want to address a few concerns.\n\n-Therapy is expensive. \nWhen I started with my current therapist it was 1500/hour and now turned to 2000/hour.\nHonestly, this is a price that many people cannot afford.\nSometimes I hold myself as well, I cannot afford to pay this amount for a month.\n\nAnother thing that I'll want to address:\n-Most of the time, these bills are not reimbursable under your workplace's health policy.\nSo, you have to pay this from your own pocket.\n\nThis email is from my college era.\nI was struggling and had thoughts of self-harm and suicide, some of which I practiced.\nI desperately needed help.\nI couldn't afford therapy.\nNaturally, I tried free resources. \nSome didnâ€™t answer, some had long delays in responding â€“ days, even weeks. When youâ€™re at your lowest, waiting weeks for help doesnâ€™t work.\n\nWhat I want to call out here is - \nThe truth is, even though we talk about mental health more today, affordable access to counselors and therapists is still a privilege. \nFree resources exist, but they arenâ€™t always efficient or readily available when someone is in crisis.\n\nThis wasn't the first time that I tried/had thoughts of harming myself and it wasn't definitely the last.\n\nWhile I am thankful for such organisations, personally they were of no use for me.\nYou go to the internet for help when you don't have any other options left, getting a reply after 3-4 weeks may not be helpful for you.\nAs a college student, I didn't have funds nor knowledge on how to approach these thoughts and how to get myself out of this.\n\nEvery time I post about these things, people still think that it is for seeking attention.\nI do seek attention but not for myself.\nI want you to talk about this.\nI want us to learn the basics at least on how to talk to a person who is going through something and don't have the money for therapy.\nI want you to check on your friends and family.\n\nYour words and presence might mean more than you realize.\n\nAnd the most important thing-\nPlease don't hire/listen to people who are not qualified for working with people dealing with mental health problems.\nI had a terrible experience that I'll probably share later.\n\nItâ€™s not easy to be vulnerable here, but I hope that by sharing my experience, someone else might feel less alone or feel encouraged to seek help.\n\nIf youâ€™re going through something right now, know that youâ€™re not alone. Reaching out is hard, but your feelings are valid, and help is out there â€“ even if it feels far away at times.\n\nEvery year, millions of people struggle with mental health battles they keep hidden. \nIn fact, suicide rates have been increasing worldwide, and itâ€™s one of the leading causes of death, especially among young people. \n\nIn the end, I'll just like to say-\nPeople are already going through a lot, please don't make their life harder. Be kind, it costs nothing.",
